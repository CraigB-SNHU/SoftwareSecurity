<h4>Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?</h4>
<p>The client for this project was Artemis Financial, a consulting company that develops financial plans for it's customers around the world.  The company wanted to update it's operations using the latest and most secure software.</p>

<h4>What did you do well when you found your client's software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company's overall well-being?</h4>
<p>It is important to code securely because attackers are constantly trying to break an application's code to expose vulnerabilities.  Being proficient with secure coding practices makes you a much better candidate for jobs where security is paramount.  Financial institutions such as the scenario in this course is one example, but others include the medical and defense industry.  Although being hacked is never a good thing, it has a wide range of consequences from being inconvenienced to serious financial losses.  However, the consequences are catastrophic when classified information is breached, or the equipment stops running at a hospital.  Careless coding practices could potentially end up costing people their lives.</p>

<h4>Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?</h4>
<p>It took me a couple of tries to get the OWASP dependency check right.  I didn't realize how long it took to download all the updates the first time around so I ended up closing out the terminal early.  Because of that, I couldn't figure out why I couldn't find the dependency check file.  Once I paid closer attention to the terminal running and let the process finish it was easy to find where it was.  When I first opened the file I was a bit overwhelmed by how much information was there and how to sort through it. <br>
What I found most helpful, even though it was also challenging, was the manual code analysis.  It's not obvious at first how certain lines of code exposed vulnerabilities, but once you are aware of it, it makes you better at coding.  An example of this is using safeguards to make sure data that the user enters won't cause the program to crash.</p>

<h4>How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?</h4>
<p>The layers of security were increased with a combination of different approaches from manually inspecting the code to running static tests.</p>

<h4>How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?</h4>
<p>One of the ways was through the dependency check.  After refactoring the code, it was necessary to run the dependency check again to make sure no new vulnerabilities were introduced.</p>

<h4>What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?</h4>
<p>Running the OWASP dependency check was a useful tool to learn.  Other valuable tools were Maven and Spring.  I struggled with them at first but I'm starting to get better with using them.</p>

<h4>Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?</h4>
<p>There are a lot of skills that I learned from this class that I believe future employers will find valuable.  Secure coding aside, this class helped me to learn Maven and Spring / Spring Boot.  </p>
